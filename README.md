This tool uses ERA5 climate reanalysis data to identify and visualize seasonal and long-term trends in prescribed burn suitability across Humboldt County, CA. For each grid cell in the study area, it calculates the number and percentage of days in each month that meet specified weather criteria for safe burns. Over multiple years, it detects trends using slope analysis and outputs maps, tables, and graphs to support land managers in burn planning.
